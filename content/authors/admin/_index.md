Hi there! I'm Bilal Naeem, an engineer with a knack for turning complex problems into simple solutions and a penchant for diving deep into the world of 0s and 1s. With a Master's in Computer Science from Purdue and a Bachelor's from LUMS, I've ventured through the realms of virtualization, software security, and much more, always with a cup of coffee in hand and a curiosity that never fades.
